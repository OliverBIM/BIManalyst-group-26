## Focus area:
Longest spanding beam in model. 

## Claim by code
The biggest beam span is 11 meters throughout the model. 

## The report and page number or section that you found the claim in:
Report = CES_BLD_24_06_STR
Claim page number = 6 under "Static System"
Claim = "The biggest span of a slab is 7 meters while the longest spanning beam is 11 meters, while most beams span 6-8 meters"

## Description of your script
If a structural engineer recieves a building-model from an external contractor or architecht, it may be convenvient to be able to check that no ground-mistakes are found in the model.

The aim of the script is to find the beam with the maximum span and showcase the name. 

The claim is that the biggest span of the beams are 11 meters, so this needs to be checked if true or false.

We found the maximum span to be 14.020m, but thats becuase the modellers made the beam to go "through" the coloums, so thats why it doens't comply with the report.

The code is written in "A1 - Forensic BIM"
